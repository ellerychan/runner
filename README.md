**Runner** is a simple Python application that creates buttons for commands that it reads from a file.
It is useful for debugging and testing.

Each button has a text field to the right of it containing the text of the command.  The text field is editable, for on-the-fly changes.

**Runner** is written in plain old Python with Tkinter, so it will run anywhere.  Commands are executed using the *subprocess* module.
